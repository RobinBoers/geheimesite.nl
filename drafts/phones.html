  I'm 17. I strongly dislike my phone. You never thought you'd ever hear those two
sentences from the same person, did you?
</p><p>

I started feeling like this a few years back. My parents decided I couldn't
charge my phone at night, and consequently my phone died a lot during the day.
After a while, I stopped missing it. Even if I have it with me, I don't us it
anymore.
<a href="//blog.geheimesite.nl/post/een-maand-zonder-telefoon">I challenged myself 
to go a month without using my phone last year</a>, and my primary conclusion was that
most inconvience caused by not having a phone, is imposed by the expectations
and assumptions of other people. 
</p><p>
I hate the fact that I'm expected to always be available for everyone. All it
takes is one tap and "ping". It's annoying. Every time I'm trying to actually
get something done, my phone just keeps going "beep", "boop", "ping", "pong". 
It's like someone is tapping my shoulder every few minutes. "can I have your
attention please UwU". My concentration is already severly fractured. 
I don't want to know that
you've tagged me, I don't feel like sending selfies back and forth and I don't
care that some artist released a new album. I JUST WANT TO GET MY SHIT DONE.
</p><p>
But, that's easily solved. My phone is always on "Do Not Disturb". However,
people still <em>expect</em> me read and reply instantly. <em>That's what
bothers me</em>. The fucking social pressure to participate.
</p><p>
Furthermore, everyone expects you to have and always carry a phone with you. Oh yes,
<em>let's do a Kahoot</em>, or some other activity requiring a phone. Or <em>just scan
this QR code and you'll be done</em>. Or how about we put the schedule on a
mobile app? You need a mobile phone to get a DigiD, which is needed to access your 
medical records, apply for vaccines, pay your taxes. Sooner or later I need to setup
mobile banking on my phone, becausedevice I use for logging into the online banking 
portal doesn't have replaceable batteries and they won't replace it when it
dies.</p><p>

It's small things. I know. But it's so annoying.
</p><p>
Phones are supposed to be tools. Tools should never, ever, <em>ever</em>, have 
control over us. We're supposed to be the master of our tools, not the other
way around.
