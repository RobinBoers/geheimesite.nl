# Roblog.nl

This repo contains the source code of [Roblog.nl][https://roblog.nl], my
personal website and blog. It contains beautiful handcoded HTML and a bunch of
scripts to manage it.

It's basically my own SSG written in pure Bash.

## Features

- RSS & Atom feeds
- Sitemap with last modified dates
- [Image compression](https://git.dupunkto.org/meta/dotfiles/tree/bin/optim)
- [Custom shortcodes](https://git.dupunkto.org/meta/dotfiles/tree/bin/shortc) in
  HTML

## Setup

The working directory of the repo contains two subdirectories:

- `src` contains the raw HTML source code for the site.
- `dist` contains the built site.
