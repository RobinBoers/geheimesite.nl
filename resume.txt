# Robin Boers

**Developer & webdesigner**  
hello@geheimesite.nl

## Technical skills

I'm pretty good at building websites. Iâ€™m fluent in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Elixir and Phoenix. Additionally, I'm comfortable with the Linux commandline. 

I also have experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Svelte, end-to-end encryption, tailwindcss and deployment to Fly.io.

I can work with PHP and WordPress, but I'd rather use a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator).
