Hi, my name is Robin.

_TL;DR I have an [/me page](/me) where you can find all my contact info._

I have a little blog where I write about things that interest me.
Here's how you can get in touch:

-   Shoot me an email at [hello@geheimesite.nl](mailto:hello@geheimesite.nl).
-   Send me a friend request over at Discord (Robijntje22#9914)
-   Comment on one of my posts (it can take me a while, but eventually I will see it).
-   I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-boers-b18691229/), but I rarely use it (except to promote my blog).
-   I have a Reddit profile, but I only use it to endlessly scroll, not for contacting people.
-   I hate social media, so I'm not on Facebook (but that's just because I'm young), Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat or TikTok.
