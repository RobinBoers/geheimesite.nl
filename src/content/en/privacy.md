This site **does not** track you or store your personal information in any way. I do not use cookies and won't save your information, but third parties might.

## Google fonts

I stopped using Google fonts when I discovered they were tracking my visitors. If you use Google fonts served from Google they can see your IP address and will save it. My web fonts are now self-hosted.

## Blog statistics

I wrote my own little tool for keeping track of _visits_ (not views) on my blog. It's completely anonymous; I just know that _someone_ loaded the page at that moment. If you want [you can look at the source code](https://github.com/RobinBoers/api.geheimesite.nl/tree/master/views).

You can also exlude your visits from being tracked by entering this in the browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("plsDontTrack", true)
```

## Follow.it

If you choose to follow me via Follow.it, they will process your information according to [their privacy statement](https://follow.it/info/privacy) (which I have not read).

## YouTube embeds

This site uses [Invidious](https://invidious.io) for YouTube embeds. They do not store your personal information.
