This is a little digital library of sorts. It contains all the books I have read that I could find a record of[^1], and all books I'd like to read in the future. This page was definitely inspired by [hidde.blog](https://hidde.blog/books/).

{{< books shelve="currently-reading" >}}

{{< books shelve="want-to-read" >}}

{{< books shelve="finished" >}}

[^1]: Either because they are on a physical bookshelf in my house or because they're in the digital records of the the library. Unfortunately the library records only go back as far as 2018, so this page is far from complete.
