A Framboy is a supercharged Gameboy. It cannot only play Gameboy games, it can also play retro games up to the Nintendo 64 and all games a modern computer can play via Steam Link. Apart from that it also plays Spotify. You think that's cool? Wait until you see this: it can make calls.

## Features

-   Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in
-   Online multiplayer
-   Listen to music
-   Play modern games
-   Make calls _(coming soon)_

### Online multiplayer

The Framboy can play online multiplayer using RetroArch [Netplay](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Netplay/). That means you can play games with your friends while you're both at home.

### Spotify & Music

The Framboy plays music via Spotify. This means it allows you to listen to your favorite music while playing games with your friends. But there's more: the Framboy [blocks ads by default](https://github.com/abba23/spotify-adblock), and you can also download music, for listening without Wi-Fi.

### Modern games

[Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/) allows you to play every game you can run on a modern computer on the Framboy. It links your PC to the Framboy. The games run via the PC, but you can play always everywhere. Very nice!

## About the project

I have had the idea for this project since around 2019. When I first saw alternative OSes like Linux and Android I wondered if I could turn an old laptop I had lying around into an Xbox. Obviously, I failed. But I did discover the wonderful world of retro gaming.

Ever since then I've been thinking about building a retro gaming handheld. My first attempt was in 2020 when I built the [Frambo](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/2020/08/de-frambo-diy-raspberry-pi-spelcomputer.html).

In 2021 I got really annoyed by smartphone brands like Apple and Samsung. Specifically the durability and non-repairability of the devices. I decided I wanted to [try to make my own phone](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/2021/01/ik-wil-zelf-een-telefoon-maken.html).

But when I was searching for components for the phone I realized I rather have a physical keyboard and gaming controls. I always loved the Gameboy, so I ordered a Gameboy case. I haven't finished the project yet. I'm still waiting for components (specifically the screen and the keyboard) to arrive. I decided I first wanted to create the gaming/computer aspect of the project, and then later expand it to add the ability to make phone calls.

## How to build a Framboy

The Framboy is my newest hardware project. You can build one yourself! These are the components required:

-   PiSugar (Battery)
-   Raspberry Pi Zero W or Raspberry Pi Zero 2
-   Gameboy case
-   2.8-inch screen
-   Mini Bluetooth or USB keyboard

When I've finished the project I will post a full building guide and video with more info.
