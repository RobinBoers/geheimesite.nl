        I'm at the end of 5VWO now. I'm getting kinda nervous for my exams next
        year. And Oh. My. God. I'm almost 18 years old. That's a big scary
        number with a lot of attached responsibilities. Also yesterday some kid
        called me "mister". LIKE WHAT??
      </p>

        I'm trying very hard to improve my German grade because currently it's a
        7 (out of 10) and I'd like it to be an 8, because then there's a
        non-zero chance that I'll finish VWO with honors (cum laude in Dutch).

        I've replaced my phone with a Casio watch, Discman, paper notebook, and
        Nokia flip phone. I'm very pleased. It's like the Unix philosophy IRL.
        All my tools do <em>one</em> thing, and they do it <em>very well</em>.
        And I only need to charge them once every one to two weeks. Also, my
        every step is no longer tracked by Google. And I'm not distracted all
        the time. Overall, brilliant idea!

        I think I might be a Swiftie. Like not a hardcore fan, but I do really
        like her music. I'm not that well versed in all the easter eggs and
        decades of lore tho. Tho I do have four of her albums as CDs
        (<cite>1989</cite>, <cite>Red</cite>, <cite>reputation</cite>, and
        <cite>TTPD</cite>), and I'm intending to get four more
        (<cite>Lover</cite>, <cite>Fearless</cite>, <cite>Speak Now</cite>,
        <cite>Midnights</cite>).

        I'm working on a prototype
        <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/pull/5859"
          >for merging two-factor authentication into
          <code>phx.gen.auth</code></a
        >. I'm also building
        <a href="/blog/challenge-accepted">an experimantal website engine</a>
        that blends multiple layers of the Web.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also thinking more about
        <a href="/blog/0x10c">interactive end-user programming</a>.
        <del
          >Would make a cool subject for my
          <abbr title="profielwerkstuk">PWS</abbr>...</del

      <p>
        Actually, I'm gonna do my PWS for English. It's really cool!! We're
        going to design an artificial (constructed) languages from scratch.
        Let's see how this goes!

      <p>
        I've shelved
        <a href="//git.dupunkto.org/grape-lang"
          >The Grape Programming Language</a
        >
        and <a href="//git.dupunkto.org/somtomorrow">Somtomorrow</a>, but do
        intend to finish them sometime the upcoming years.
