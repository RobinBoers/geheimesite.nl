        I'm at the end of 5VWO now. I'm getting kinda nervous for my exams next
        year. And Oh. My. God. I'm almost 18 years old. That's a big scary
        number with a lot of attached responsibilities. Also yesterday some kid
        called me "mister". LIKE WHAT??

        In a few weeks there's a school trip to Berlin and I'm very excited!!

        I'm trying very hard to improve my German grade because currently it's a
        7 (out of 10) and I'd like it to be an 8, because then there's a
        non-zero chance that I'll finish VWO with honors (cum laude in Dutch).

        I've replaced my phone with a Casio watch, Discman, paper notebook, and
        Nokia flip phone. I'm very pleased. It's like the Unix philosophy IRL.
        All my tools do <em>one</em> thing, and they do it <em>very well</em>.
        And I only need to charge them once every one to two weeks. Also, my
        every step is no longer tracked by Google. And I'm not distracted all
        the time.

        I think I might be a Swiftie. Like not a hardcore fan, but I do really like her music. But I didn't know what the Eras Tour was when one of my friends asked, so maybe I'm not such a fan after all. I do have three of her albums as CDs (1989, Red and TTPD) tho, and I'm intending to buy two more (reputation and Lover).

        I'm working on a prototype for merging two-factor authentication into
        <code>phx.gen.auth</code>. I'm also building
        <a href="/blog/challenge-accepted">an experimantal website engine</a>
        that blends multiple layers of the Web.

      <p>
        I'm always working on my website. Currently I'm thinking about rewriting
        it in Rust, because MacOS is <em>shit</em> and I'm <em>shit</em> because
        I apparently didn't use POSIX options for the coreutils that I'm using
        in my Bash-based SSG. Whoops!
      </p>

        I've shelved
        <a href="//git.dupunkto.org/grape-lang"
          >The Grape Programming Language</a
        >
        and <a href="//git.dupunkto.org/somtomorrow">Somtomorrow</a>, but do
        intend to finish them sometime the upcoming years.
