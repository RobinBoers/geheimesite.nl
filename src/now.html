      <h2>Small websites</h2>

      <p>
        I'm trying to formulate my thoughts regarding the Web. As I've said in
        the past: <i>I love building websites; I also hate the Web</i>. I don't
        hate the Web. I just hate what it has become. As a tool for expression
        and distribution of content it's great! And that's what it should be: a
        very nice document reader. But currently we're treating it as an SDK of
        some sort. A universal application development toolkit. And I get that,
        but I completely disagree. I'm part of the problem tho; at my job I
        build webapps and CMSs. However, I'd like to be part of the solution
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm thinking about how to build better websites. So far, I have a few
        important things:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The less HTML and CSS, the more accessible and lightweight the website
          will be.
        </li>
        <li>Nothing beats static HTML in terms of speed.</li>
        <li>
          Use the low-tech solutions while building your sites: prefer CSS over
          JS and prefer HTML over CSS. And beyond that, prefer dedicated
          protocols (FTP, IRC, RSS) over writing a HTML interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you feel the need to write JavaScript, you're probably building
          something that shouldn't be a website.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm trying to build a workflow that I can build lightweight, small,
        accessible and sustainable websites with, which would still have the
        benefits that draws people to heavy tools like WordPress. I think there
        is some real potential and demand, especially from clients who care
        about the environmental costs of building websites.
      </p>

      <p>Anyways, these are all some loose thoughts.</p>

      <h2>My own Search Engine..?</h2>

      <p>
        Is it just me, or have search results gotten
        <a href="//dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying">really</a>
        <a
          href="//thejollyteapot.com/2022/02/16/google-search-isn-t-very-good-and-yet-still-the-best-around"
          >shitty</a
        >? When I search for something, the only fucking results that I get are
        AI generated SEO bullshit. And I'm done with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been thinking about what I want a search engine to do. It should
        do basically this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Search Wikipedia.
            <a
              href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#English-language_Wikipedia"
              >Apparently you can download the entirety of (English) Wikipedia
              in just 19GB</a
            >
            (compressed). This is excluding any page history/talk pages, and the
            dump doesn't contain media. But still, 19GB is not that much. It
            expands to around 90GB, but I think that's manageable if I run it on
            a local server.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Crawl and index Stack Exchange sites. Think Stack Overflow, Server
            Fault, Super User, Unix & Linux, Mathematics, and Ask Ubuntu.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Optionally record my browsing history via a browser extension. This
            should be optional and contain a blacklist containing domains that
            shouldn't be recorded — like search pages. Results from my own
            browser history should be less prominent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Crawl websites on the small web. If you're wondering what the heck
            I'm talking about, this explanation from
            <a href="//www.marginalia.nu/marginalia-search"
              ><cite>Marginalia Search</cite></a
            >
            describes it pretty well:
          </p>

          <blockquote cite="https://www.marginalia.nu/marginalia-search/about/">
            <p>
              Remember when you used to explore the Internet, when you used to
              discover cool little websites made by people and it wasn't just a
              bunch of low effort content mill listicles and blog spam?<br />
              In recent years, something has been simmering: Some call it the
              “Small Internet”. I hesitate to call it a movement, that would
              imply a level of organization and intent that it does not possess.
              It's a disjointed group of like-minded people that recognize that
              the Internet has lost a certain je ne sais quoi, it has turned
              from a wild and creative space, into more of shopping mall. Where
              ever you go, you're prodded to subscribe to newsletters, to like
              and comment, to buy stuff.
            </p>

            There's a bunch of small indexes and search engines like this. I was
            planning to curate my own index, based on existing indexes. There
            should also be an option for people to submit sites.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Index some prominent Linux-oriented wikis, like the Arch Wiki and
            Gentoo Wiki. They seem to run the same wiki software as Wikipedia,
            so maybe they have a download option as well?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Searching man pages and RFCs seems cool?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Support for bangs, like DuckDuckGo has. I'd want <code>!g</code> for
            Whoogle results and <code>!y</code> for Invidious.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This hypothetical search engine would be mainly for personal use, but I
        wouldn't mind putting it on a public site if I were to build it.
      </p>

          Update: I've come to the conclusion that what I <em>really</em> want
          is a something like
          <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" target="_blank">Dash</a>. However,
          it could still be interesting to build a search engine that searches
          everything I've read, by connecting to my RSS reader. Think something
          similar to
          <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/monocle" target="_blank"
            >Monocle</a
          >.
