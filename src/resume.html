      <p>
        <strong>Elixir Developer & webdesigner</strong><br>

      </p>

      <h2>Technical skills</h2>

      <p>
        I'm pretty good at building websites. I know HTML/CSS, obviously. I'm also
        fluent in Elixir and JavaScript, amd I know a little PHP and Python too. 
        I generally prefer high-level functional programming languages without 
        mutable references.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm comfortable on the UNIX commandline and with Git version control.
        I also have experience with various flavours of SQL (mainly PostgresSQL at work 
        and MySQL for hobby projects) and a few styling frameworks, of which I
        liked TailwindCSS the best. I know a little Docker, but trust me, you don't
        want me to deploy production-critical software without supervision.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Overall, while I do have my own preferences and opinions,
        I'm capable of picking up any technology and going with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yes, I can work with WordPress, but I'd rather use a
        <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">
          Static Site Generator.
        </a>
      </p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Organisation</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Co-founder &amp; maintainer</td>

            <td>2021-Current</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        At Qdentity, I worked with Elixir, Phoenix LiveView and TailwindCSS and
        I built <a href="//sharefox.eu">Sharefox</a> along with some other internal APIs.
        Later, I also worked extensively on major parts and/or features of their CMS.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also built <a href="webdesign.html">websites</a> as independent
        webdesigner for various people throughout the years.
      </p>

        <small>Yup, that's not a lot, I know :)</small>
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm still in consideration about what study I will do after high school. Feel free
        to email me if you have suggestions.
      </p>

      <h2>Languages</h2>

      <p>
        I speak both Dutch, which is my native language, as well as English,
        which I learned through online interactions and a lot of Netflix
        (and I also got courses at school of course ;)
      </p>

      <p>
        My English is fairly decent in terms of grammar and general fluency, however,
        I find my vocabulary to be disappointingly narrow, as it is primarily
        computer-focused. So basically, I can talk for hours about anything related to UNIX, 
        networking, cryptography, mathmatics, or related subjects, but I'll struggle to 
        formulate even a single sentence if you ask me about my holiday.
      </p>
