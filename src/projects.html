      <h1>Projects</h1>

      <p>
        At work, I code in Elixir and Javascript. In my free time however, I
        like to play around with *NIX systems. I'm always trying to build new
        things to improve my "workflow" or make things look pretty. Basically, a
        r/unixp0rn user :P
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a selection of some of the stuff I've built. For the rest, take a
        look on <a href="//git.dupunkto.org">{du}punkto</a>.
      </p>

      <table class="h-feed projects">
        <thead>
          <tr>

            <th>Description</th>

            <td>
              A general purpose programming language made for rapid-pase
              prototyping. The goal is a functional language with the nice
              syntax of Elixir or Ruby, but compiled to statically linked
              binaries.

              A fully fledged RSS reader written in Elixir. Runs as a daemon in
              the background that multiple clients, like a CLI and webapp, can
              connect to. Handles pulling feeds concurrently and storing them in
              the database.

              Web-based editor for Chromebooks made using CodeMirror and CSS
