      <title>Thoughts on the mobile phone ban</title>

      <content:encoded> <![CDATA[ <p> Last month the Dutch government announced that from next year on mobile phones will be banned in high school. As a student who is currently in high school, I think it's a fundamentally good development, but the media attention around it just feels wrong. They present a greatly exaggerated story praising this measure the government imposed to protect the youth against themselves. </p>  <p> The news is full of items of cherry-picked comments from teenagers who feel "relieved" because they "finally talk to each other". But also teenagers who are sad because "they won't have any memories of high school if they can't take photos". </p>  <p> It's all so exaggerated. Contrary to popular belief, teenagers <em>do</em> talk to each other, even in the presence of a mobile phone. In breaks, we play card games like Uno and Bullshit. We read books. We complain about how stupid school and homework is. You know, normal stuff. And our phones have a place too. Sometimes we play mobile games in the break, like <a href="//www.evilapples.com" target="_blank">Evil Apples</a> or <a href="//garticphone.com/" target="_blank">Gartic Phone</a>. But that's still something we do <em>together</em>. </p>  <p> And, yes, phones are distracting. Yes, they cause mayhem from time to time. Yes, social media is shit, I know. But all of that is also true for adults. These apps are made to be extremely addictive, it's their fucking business model. It's not just teenagers who get addicted. Even the people who built these apps in the first place, who know how they work and what tricks are used to exploit our phycology, they still <a href="//thesocialdilemma.com">weren't able to restrain themselves</a>. Adults aren't magically immune. </p>  <p> It feels like it's a bunch of grey birds pointing their finger at the youth and going "you can't get off your phones, and now we're going to take them away to protect you", and then continuing to celebrate on social media. Hypocrisy at its peak. </p>  <p> So yes, I think it's great that phones have been banned in high schools. Nu de tweede kamer nog. </p>  <details> <summary>Extras</summary> <p> Some other notes: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Schools spent years digitizing everything. Schedules, grades, homework, study materials and more are now all exclusively available in web applications. They made this move with the assumption that these platforms would always be accessible for students via their mobile phone (a wrong assumption by the way, because this excludes students like myself that would rather leave their phone at home). How are schools going to deal with this? </p> </li> <li> <p> How are schools going to enforce this? They've been burdened with enough additional administrative tasks already. And what even counts as a mobile phone? <del>Do all mobile devices count? What about my iPad? Or an old iPod Touch? My DIY Raspberry Pi Zero project with a rectangular touch screen? And what if it were a square instead? And what about smartwatches? They can TikTok too. Does every portable device with an internet connection fall under this new law?</del> </p> <p> <ins>Update: I read the law on rijksoverheid.nl and they include "smartphones", "tablets", and "smartwatches". <em>However</em>, they do not provide a definition for these terms. Disappointing.</ins> </p> </li> </ul> </details> ]]> </content:encoded>

      <title>Phones, assumptions and expectations</title>

      <content:encoded> <![CDATA[ <p> I'm 17. I strongly dislike my phone. You never thought you'd ever hear those two sentences from the same person, did you? </p> <p> I started feeling like this a few years back. My parents decided I couldn't charge my phone at night, and consequently my phone died a lot during the day. After a while, I stopped missing it. Even if I have it with me, I don't use it anymore. <a href="//blog.geheimesite.nl/post/een-maand-zonder-telefoon" >I challenged myself to put away my phone for a month last year</a >, and my primary conclusion was that most inconvience caused by not having a phone, is imposed by the expectations and assumptions of other people. </p> <p> I hate the fact that I'm expected to always be available for everyone. All it takes is one tap and "ping". It's annoying. Every time I'm trying to actually get something done, my phone just keeps going "beep", "boop", "ping", "pong". It's like someone is tapping my shoulder every few minutes. "Can I have your attention please UwU". My concentration is already severly fractured. I don't want to know that you've tagged me, I don't feel like sending selfies back and forth and I don't care that some artist released a new album. <em>I just want to get my shit done</em>. </p> <p> That's easily solved tho. My phone is always on silent. However, people still <em>expect</em> me read and reply instantly. That's what bothers me: the fucking social pressure to participate. </p> <p> Furthermore, everyone assumes you to have and always carry a phone with you. Oh yes, <em>let's do a Kahoot</em>! Or some other activity requiring a phone. Or <em>just scan this QR code and you'll be done</em>. Or how about we put the schedule on a mobile app? You'll need a smartphone to get a DigiD too, which is needed to access your medical records, apply for vaccines, and pay your taxes. Sooner or later you'll need to setup mobile banking as well, because the device we use for signing into the online banking portal doesn't have replaceable batteries and we won't give you a replacement when it eventually dies. </p> <p>It's small things. I know.<br />But it's so annoying.</p>  <!--<p> Phones are supposed to be tools. Tools should never, ever, <em>ever</em>, have control over us. We're supposed to be the master of our tools, not the other way around. </p>--> ]]> </content:encoded>
