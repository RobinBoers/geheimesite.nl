    <h1>Interactive end-user programming in 0x10<sup>c</sup></h1>

    <p>
      It has been a few years since I learned about
      <a href="//yewtu.be/watch?v=O1aCbbeFN7E">0x10<sup>c</sup></a>
      (pronounced "ten to the c") in a documentary about Notch, the creator of
      Minecraft. It's the game he built after he stepped down from his role as
      lead developer of Minecraft&mdash;Minecraft's unfinished sequel.
    </p>

    <p>
      0x10<sup>c</sup> was supposed to be a space-themed sandbox game. It takes
      place around 281,474,976,710,656 AD, which is (you guessed it) 0x10<sup
        >c</sup
      >
      in hexidecimal notation. The game's backstory, as told by Notch on the
      blog, was this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel
        was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all
        popular 16 bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas the
        DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This led to a severe
        bug in the included drivers, causing a requested sleep of 0x0000 0000
        0000 0001 years to last for 0x0001 0000 0000 0000 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people are
        starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of extinction, with all
        remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long since
        ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Among other things, the game featured an emulated 16-bit computer named
      DCPU-16 that players could use to interact with their spaceship in various
      ways, and they could even extend the game with self-written programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think that's such a neat idea: a programmable environment inside of the
      game. I've been thinking about a game with a similar in-game virtual
      machine. The game would be written
      <em>in</em> that very virtual machine, and exposed to the player, so that
      the player can interact with and change the game as the please, while they
      play. Full control over the mechanics and environment of game with live
      feedback; it opens up so many possibilities for interesting gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it like <a href="/v/19//sonic-pi.net">Sonic Pi</a>, but instead
      of composing live music, you adapt your surroundings and
      <em>the literal laws of physics</em>. Creating gameplay and solving
      challenges by adapting the rules of the game. The game doesn't guide the
      player, but the player has full control over the game.
    </p>

      Unfortunately Notch abandoned 0x10<sup>c</sup>, he never finished or
      released it. I don't know if this is how it was supposed to work. There's
      very little known about the game&mdash;a lot of rumors and a few videos is
      all we have left. But I can't get this idea out of my head.
      <em>One day I'll make this game a reality.</em>
