      <h1>Subscribe</h1>

      <p>
        I don’t like social media. Actually, I hate it. Instead, I have a few
        RSS feeds:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a>primary feed, dutch</a></li>
        <li><a>less frequent posts, english</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is RSS?</h2>

      <p>
        Basically, RSS is like your Facebook feed, but instead of an algorithm
        deciding what to show you, you choose what to subscribe too yourself.
        That means it is fully in your control: no ads, no data mining. It's a
        bit like an email newsletter, but without giving your email to some
        American company for them to sell to spammers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a very simple system: a website exposes an RSS feed. A feed is a
        simple text file that contains links to all their posts with a little
        description. This isn't "personalised", it's more like a printed
        newspaper. You can use an RSS reader to subscribe to that feed, and
        you'll get an update when someone posts something new.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subscribing is dead simple to do: you subscribe to someone by entering
        the URL to their blog, website, channel, profile into your RSS reader
        app. Then, the app will check their feed for updates every few hours,
        and show the posts in reverse-chronological order. Some apps also
        provide other filters for showing the content, but whatever you choose,
        it's always <em>under your control</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to read the feeds you need an
        <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator">RSS reader</a>. I
        recommend <a href="//inoreader.com">Inoreader</a> or
        <a href="//netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>.
