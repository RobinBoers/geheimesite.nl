      <h1>Phones, assumptions and expectations</h1>

      <p>
        I'm 17. I strongly dislike my phone. You never thought you'd ever hear
        those two sentences from the same person, did you?
      </p>

      <p>
        I started feeling like this a few years back. My parents decided I
        couldn't charge my phone at night, and consequently my phone died a lot
        during the day. After a while, I stopped missing it. Even if I have it
        with me, I don't use it anymore.

          >I challenged myself to put away my phone for a month last year</a
        >, and my primary conclusion was that most inconvience caused by not
        having a phone, is imposed by the expectations and assumptions of other
        people.
      </p>

        I hate the fact that I'm expected to always be available for everyone.
        All it takes is one tap and <i>ping</i>. It's annoying. Every time I'm
        trying to actually get something done, my phone just keeps going
        <i>beep boop ping pong</i>. It's like someone is tapping my shoulder
        every few minutes. "Can I have your attention please?" My concentration
        is already severly fractured. I don't want to know that you've tagged
        me, I don't feel like sending selfies back and forth and I don't care
        that some artist released a new album.
        <em>I just want to get my shit done</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phones are supposed to be tools. We're supposed to be the master of our
        tools, not the other way around. Tools should never, ever,
        <em>ever</em>, have control over us.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's easily solved tho. My phone is always on silent. However, people
        still <em>expect</em> me read and reply instantly. That's what bothers
        me: the fucking social pressure to participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, everyone assumes you to have and always carry a phone with
        you. Oh yes,
        <em>let's do a Kahoot</em>! Or some other activity requiring a phone. Or
        <em>just scan this QR code and you'll be done</em>. Or how about we put
        the schedule on a mobile app? You'll need a smartphone to get a DigiD
        too, which is needed to access your medical records, apply for vaccines,
        and pay your taxes. Sooner or later you'll need to setup mobile banking
        as well, because the device we use for signing into the online banking
        portal doesn't have replaceable batteries and we won't give you a
        replacement when it eventually dies.

        It's small things. I know.<br />
        But it's so annoying.
