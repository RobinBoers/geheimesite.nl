      <h1>The role of generative AI in writing</h1>

      <p>
        Since its introduction a little more than a year ago, we've been
        discussing ChatGPT a lot at school. It's an interesting topic, for sure.
        How can it be used at school? By students or teachers? Is using AI
        cheating? Will using it aid in the development of writing skill or slow
        it? Should it be used at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, we seem to have the urge to ban upcoming technologies that
        radically change things. Indeed, I've repeatedly heard people call to
        ban use of generative AI, calling it plagiarism and fraud. However, like
        everything, the matter is more nuanced than seems to be the case at
        first sight. Even if we were to completely ban generative AI, enforcing
        a ban like that will prove harder and harder the further models like GPT
        evolve. Besides, it probably won't restrain students from using models
        like them. Therefore, we should think about and discuss how we could
        properly integrate AI models into our writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, here are some of the primary takeaways after using
        ChatGPT on-and-off for about a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is—mistakenly—mainly used to <em>generate</em> prose. However,
        the prose it generates is mediocre; it's dull and repetitive.
        Moreover,—even tho OpenAI tries to prevent it—the model hallucinates
        fairly often. This means nothing it generates can be trusted to be
        factually correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it is way more powerful as a tool to edit and transform
        language. As Linus wrote a while back:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://thesephist.com/posts/latent/">
        <p>
          Not "computers can complete text prompts, now what?" but "computers
          can understand language, now what?"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Instead of prompting "can you generate an argumentative essay on the
        role of religion in public schools", we should prompt things like "can
        you rewrite this paragraph to be more academic" or "can you show me
        alternatives to this sentence".
      </p>
      <p>
        ChatGPT and similar models are not a threat to writing. Instead, they
        are merely new tools that can—if utilized correctly—further improve our
        writing. The impact they will have is purely defined by how we use them.
