        <h1>The role of generative AI in writing</h1>

        <p>
          Since its introduction a little more than a year ago, we've been
          discussing ChatGPT a lot at school. It's an interesting topic, for
          sure. How can it be used in school? By students or teachers? Is using
          AI cheating? Will it interfere with the development of writing skills
          or help? Should it be used at all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, we seem to have the urge to ban upcoming technologies that
          radically change things. Indeed, I've repeatedly heard people call to
          ban use of generative AI, calling it plagiarism and fraud. However,
          like everything, the matter is more nuanced than seems to be the case
          at first sight. Even if we were to completely ban generative AI,
          enforcing a ban like that will prove harder and harder the further
          models like GPT evolve. Besides, it probably won't restrain students
          from using models like them. Therefore, we should think about and
          discuss how we could properly integrate AI models into our writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, here are some of the primary takeaways after using
          ChatGPT on-and-off for about a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is—mistakenly—mainly used to <em>generate</em> prose. However,
          the prose it generates is mediocre; it's dull and repetitive.
          Moreover,—even tho OpenAI tries to prevent it—the model hallucinates
          fairly often. This means nothing it generates can be trusted to be
          factually correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, it is way more powerful as a tool to edit and transform
          language. As Linus wrote a while back:
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://thesephist.com/posts/latent/">
          <p>
            Not "computers can complete text prompts, now what?" but "computers
            can understand language, now what?"
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The AI models are unable to understand what they are writing about.
          They're only selecting words that sound plausible given the context of
          their training data and the prompt. But they do know grammar,
          spelling, and essay structure. That's where their strength lies. Not
          the ability to generate okay-sounding essays, but their ability to
          understand and transform language. Use it to your advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of prompting "can you generate an argumentative essay on the
          role of religion in public schools", we should prompt things like "can
          you rewrite this paragraph to be more academic" or "can you show me
          alternatives to this sentence".
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT and similar models are not a threat to writing. Instead, they
          are merely new tools that can—if utilized correctly—further improve
          our writing. The impact they will have is purely defined by how we use
          them.

          <p>Some additional notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LLMs are best used in combination with existing tools, like
              <a href="//jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">a good dictionary</a>,
              thesaurus, and spell checkers.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's really a bit silly to call this category of AI "generative",
              because (in my opinion) that's the thing they're worst at.

              is great and you should definitely read it!
