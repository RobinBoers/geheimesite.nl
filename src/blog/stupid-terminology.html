        <h1>Stop saying "users" and "content"</h1>

        <p>
          Terminology like <em>users</em> and <em>content</em> is demeaning and
          hurtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artists aren't creating <em>content</em> to populate our
          datasets—they're creating movies, music, essays, drawings, games,
          paintings. Labeling a work that someone created, out of passion and
          love, <em>content</em>, is frankly disrespectful. It reduces the
          creative work from something beautiful to merely another piece of
          <em>content</em>, and greatly undervalues the effort and skill
          necessary to create it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, calling people <em>users</em>, dehumanizes them. It turns
          them into a mere datapoint, or worse, an asset to be exploited.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            There are only two industries that call their customers "users":<br />
            illegal drugs and software.
          </p>

          —<cite>Edward Tufte</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Terms like these shift focus away from the humans in the equation.
          Language is the lense through which we see the world. Use it wisely.
        </p>
