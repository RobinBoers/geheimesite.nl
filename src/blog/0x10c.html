        <h1>0x10<sup>c</sup></h1>

        <p>
          It has been a few years since I learned about
          <a href="//yewtu.be/watch?v=O1aCbbeFN7E">0x10<sup>c</sup></a>
          (pronounced "ten to the c") in a documentary about Notch, the creator
          of Minecraft. It's the game he built after he stepped down from his
          role as lead developer of Minecraft--Minecraft's unfinished sequel.
        </p>

        <p>
          0x10<sup>c</sup> was supposed to be a space-themed sandbox game. It
          takes place around 281,474,976,710,656 AD, which is (you guessed it)
          0x10<sup>c</sup> in hexidecimal notation. The game's backstory, as
          told by Notch on the blog, was this:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space
            travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich
            individuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with
            all popular 16 bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian,
            whereas the DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This
            led to a severe bug in the included drivers, causing a requested
            sleep of 0x0000 0000 0000 0001 years to last for 0x0001 0000 0000
            0000 years.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people
            are starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of extinction,
            with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation
            long since ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.
          </p>

          Among other things, the game featured an emulated 16-bit computer
          named DCPU-16 that players could use to interact with their spaceship
          in various ways, and they could even extend the game with self-written
          programs.

          I think that's such a neat idea: a programmable environment inside of
          the game. I've been thinking about a game with a similar in-game
          virtual machine. The game would be written <em>in</em> that very
          virtual machine, and exposed to the player, so that the player can
          interact with and change the game as the please, while they play. Full
          control over the mechanics and environment of game with live feedback;
          it opens up so many possibilities for interesting gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of it like <a href="//sonic-pi.net">Sonic Pi</a>, but instead of
          composing live music, you adapt your surroundings and
          <em>the literal laws of physics</em>. Creating gameplay and solving
          challenges by adapting the rules of the game. The game doesn't guide
          the player, but the player has full control over the game.
        </p>

          Unfortunately Notch abandoned 0x10<sup>c</sup>, he never finished or
          released it. I don't know if this is how it was supposed to work.
          There's very little known about the game--a lot of rumors and a few
          videos is all we have left. But I can't get this idea out of my head.
          <em>One day I'll make this game a reality.</em>
