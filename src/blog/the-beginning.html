      <h1>The Beginning</h1>

      <p>
        The dawn of the universe is a paradox. There are two ways to explain it:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The universe has a beginning. Something initiated the universe,
            which raises the question: how did that thing get there? And if
            there was no thing—the universe sprung from nothing—how can all be
            made from none?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The universe has no beginning—it has always existed in some form or
            capacity. This seems contradictory: how can everything exist
            forever? All this <em>stuff</em> must come from somewhere, right?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Saying you know the truth of the origin of the universe is lying to
        yourself. Nobody knows — and nobody will ever know. We simply can't
        grasp the very beginning; it's too contradictory. It's
        all-encompassing—too immense for a single human being to fathom.
      </p>

      <p>
        We must learn to live with the fact that we might never know the truth
        to some things. And I know, that's hard. It means letting go of the
        little grip we have on reality. But ultimately, it's the only real
        answer we have.
        <em>We don't know, and that's okay.</em>
