        <h1>Rules</h1>

        <p>
          <a href="https://blog.geheimesite.nl/notes/regels/">In the past</a>
          I've written about what I called "two rules for any well-functioning
          group":
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone behaves</li>
            <li>Everyone should have fun</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          However, I was probably wrong. Because while small groups of people
          are pretty much self-organizing, as the group grows, some hierarchy is
          needed. In a relatively small group--everyone knows everyone--rules
          are generally unneeded, as people tend to behave properly due to peer
          pressure and social dynamics. However, the controlling effect of peer
          pressure breaks down in larger groups, because people are relatively
          anonymous. Social dynamics alone are not effective anymore, hence the
          need for formal rules.
        </p>

          So while you can get away with my two rules for a small group, let's
          say a classroom of around ~25 people, they will most definitely cause
          complete anarchy and chaos when applied to the entire school of around
          700 students.
        </p>

        <p>I was right about one thing tho:</p>

        <blockquote>
          If there is no basis for the rule, the rule doesn't work, or the rule
          is unneeded, it should probably not be a rule.
