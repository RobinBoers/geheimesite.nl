        <p>
          You're using the internet wrong. That's quite a statement, isn't it?

          A few months ago, I introduced my sister to <a href="/rss">RSS</a>.
          She seemed to like the idea, but she kept asking one question, over
          and over. "How do I find things to follow?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Excellent question! How <em>do</em> you find interesting things on the
          Web? The anwser? Browse it; follow links; surf around.

          The power of the Web is its hyperlinked nature. It's a <em>web</em>,
          not just a repository. Yet we're increasingly <em>searching</em> for
          everything on monolithic search engines like Google. That's bad. For
          one, it limits you to a very small portion of the Web--and it's not
          <a href="/blog/love-hate">the best part either</a>.

        <p>But also: our brain works by association:</p>

            When I get stuck on a really hard problem, whether it's some
            impossible bug in my code or my sofa not fitting through my front
            door on moving day, I close my eyes and … think really hard.
            Somewhere behind my shut eyelids and confused eyeballs, things are
            happening. Electricity is flowing through the vat of brain-stuff and
            spindly wires that somehow make up my thought process, and for a few
            seconds, they just kind of do their thing. Until, if I'm lucky, an
            answer pops into my head a few moments later.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my favorite questions to ponder these days has been: when I'm
            thinking or remembering, just in that moment when my eyes are closed
            and I'm sending all that extra energy to my brain, what's really
            happening? There are no hard drives to spin into place in my brain.
            What's taking up all that time? It's easy to wave your hands and say
            “it's just computing” or whatever, the way you expect slow computers
            under load to be. But often when I'm heads-down thinking, I'm not
            crunching numbers or solving logic puzzles in my head. I'm not
            really sure what I'm doing, but it usually feels like just staring
            into the void and hoping for some idea to pop into my mind.

              The human mind [...] operates by association. With one item in its
              grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the
              association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of
              trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other
              characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently
              followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory
              is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails,
              the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in
              nature.

            If we imagine the repository of ideas and memories in a mind as a
            kind of tangled web of ideas, “thinking” definitely involves
            traversing and scrambling across this web somehow, with some intent.
            The more obvious, trivial thoughts are the associations that are
            immediate and close by, and the more insightful thoughts may be
            jumps between ideas that are only loosely connected, or only
            connected by second- or third-degree leaps in association.

          The most valuable aspect of the Web is the ability to travese sources
          in this way. By using a search bar you're missing this crucial aspect
          of the Web.
