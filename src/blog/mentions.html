          I've implemented <em>@mentions</em> on my site, inspired by
          @devastatia's site. This allows me to tag fellow Webmasters when I
          write something referring to their work, hopefully starting
          interesting conversations.

            This is a RSS only post. Not a secret; just not noteworthy enough to
