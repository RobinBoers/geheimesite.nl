        <h1>Movies and Limited Series</h1>

        <p>So lately I've been watching a lot of Netflix.</p>

        <p>
          Generally, I'm not the kind of person that consumes a lot of media.
          I'd rather make things; I find creating things way more satisfying.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, I got a bit burned out in terms of ideas--I didn't know what
          to build-- energy, and time (school am I right :sparkles:). So,
          instead I spent about 20 hours of my life staring at a screen, looking
          at fictional characters living their almost perfect made-up lives.
        </p>

        <p>Anyways, I really enjoyed these in particular:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>After</li>
          <li>Tick, tickâ€¦ BOOM!</li>
          <li>Heartstopper</li>
          <li>Inventing Anna</li>
          <li>Bohemian Rhapsody</li>
          <li>Love, Rosie</li>
          <li>Friends with Benefits</li>
          <li>Lady Chatterley's Lover</li>
          <li>The Girl Nextdoor</li>
          <li>Queen's Gambit</li>
          <li>Don't Look Up</li>
          <li>Dirty Lines</li>
          <li>The Social Network</li>
          <li>The Playlist</li>
          <li>The Social Dilemma</li>
          <li>Yesterday</li>
          <li>I Used to Be Famous</li>
          <li>We Are the Wave</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I really enjoyed the miniseries in particular; it allows the filmmaker
          to tell a more detailed story, yet it doesn't require as much time
          (and commitment) to watch, as opposed to, for example, a 7-season-long
          show.
        </p>

        <p>
          A movie feels short when you're used to a series. But that's part of
          the appeal I think. A movie doesn't try to suck you in, like a series
          does. It just tells a story.
        </p>

          <summary>Context</summary>
          <p>
            I wrote this a while back (somewhere fall last year), but I forgot
            to publish it. I found the draft yesterday.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, a lot of movies listed above share one common theme: they're
            all semi-related to the reproductive system; I'm a teenager, after
            all ;)
