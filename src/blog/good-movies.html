      <h1>Movies and Limited Series</h1>

      <p>So lately I've been watching a lot of Netflix.</p>

      <p>
        Generally, I'm not the kind of person that consumes a lot of media. I'd
        rather make things; I find creating things way more satisfying.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I got a bit burned out in terms of ideas—I didn't know what to
        build— energy, and time (school am I right ✨). So, instead I spent
        about 20 hours of my life staring at a screen, looking at fictional
        characters living their almost perfect made-up lives.
      </p>

      <p>Anyways, I really enjoyed these in particular:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>After</li>
        <li>Tick, tick… BOOM!</li>
        <li>Heartstopper</li>
        <li>Inventing Anna</li>
        <li>Bohemian Rhapsody</li>
        <li>Love, Rosie</li>
        <li>Friends with Benefits</li>
        <li>Lady Chatterley's Lover</li>
        <li>The Girl Nextdoor</li>
        <li>Queen's Gambit</li>
        <li>Don't Look Up</li>
        <li>Dirty Lines</li>
        <li>The Social Network</li>
        <li>The Playlist</li>
        <li>The Social Dilemma</li>
        <li>Yesterday</li>
        <li>I Used to Be Famous</li>
        <li>We Are the Wave</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I really enjoyed the miniseries in particular; it allows the filmmaker
        to tell a more detailed story, yet it doesn't require as much time (and
        commitment) to watch, as opposed to, for example, a 7-season-long show.
      </p>

      <p>
        A movie feels short when you're used to a series. But that's part of the
        appeal I think. A movie doesn't try to suck you in, like a series does.
        It just tells a story.
      </p>

        <summary>Context</summary>
        <p>
          I wrote this a while back (somewhere fall last year), but I forgot to
          publish it. I found the draft yesterday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, a lot of movies listed above share one common theme: they're all
          semi-related to the reproductive system; I'm a teenager, after all ;)
