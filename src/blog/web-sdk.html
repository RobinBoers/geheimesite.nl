        <h1>The Web is the everything protocol</h1>

        <p>
          I love building websites; I also
          <a href="/blog/love-hate">hate the Web</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the concept of the Web: interlinked documents with optional
          embedded media. Just pages of text with images and videos here and
          there. Think books but with interactive elements. The Web was meant to
          be that: a great document reader.
        </p>

          Yet we're increasingly treating it as an SDK of some sort. A Universal
          Application Development ToolKit. Further and further emulating native
          applications using JavaScript APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just look at the ridiculous scope of these Javascript APIs:
          WebBattery, WebBluetooth, WebGamepad, WebVibration, WebVR, WebMIDI,
          WebUSB, WebDRM, and WebXR. What's all this <em>stuff</em> needed for?
          Yea, it makes sense for a Universal Application Development ToolKit,
          but it's absolutely absurd to implement in a document reader:

            cryptocurrency for somebody else, because what kind of insane person
            would design document reading software where that's a thing that
            could possibly happen under any circumstances?

          The Web platform is so insanely overscoped, that it's difficult to
          even begin to understand:

            The total word count of the W3C specification catalogue is 114
            million words at the time of writing. If you added the combined word
            counts of the C11, C++17, UEFI, USB 3.2, and POSIX specifications,
            all 8,754 published RFCs, and the combined word counts of everything
            on Wikipediaâ€™s list of longest novels, you would be 12 million words
            short of the W3C specifications.

          It's easy to see why it played out like this. Nowadays, every computer
          has a Web browser, which means a web app has perfect cross-platform
          compatibility at virtually no cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Worse, the Web browser is becoming
          <a href="//blog.cjeller.site/browser-as-os"
            >a standalone OS of its own</a
          >. Google's literally made their browser their OS--and it worked! To
          end users, the browser <em>is</em> the OS. It's the first thing they
          open when starting their computer. What little "desktop" applications
          they install are often built with Electron, which is just running a
          browser engine without the browser
          <abbr title="Chrome is an alternative term for UI">chrome</abbr>.
        </p>

        <p>Yet again, it's not remarkable that it played out like this:</p>

        <blockquote
          cite="//developers.slashdot.org/story/18/12/09/0941247/electron-and-the-decline-of-native-apps">
          <p>
            To paraphrase Churchill, Electron is the worst architecture for
            desktop applications, except for all the other ones that have been
            tried.
          </p>

        <p>
          My problem with the Web is that it's trying to be two very different
          things--and failing at both:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              An <abbr title="Software Development Toolkit">SDK</abbr>, a
              platform for developing and shipping applications. Javascript is
              an absolutely <a href="//jsfuck.com">horrible</a>
              <a
                href="//old.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/lwc3gj/why_a_lot_of_software_engineers_say_javascript_is/"
                >language</a
              >. For many advanced applications, the JS bundle is so
              big--looking at you, Google Earth, that the poor Chromebooks at
              school straight up crash; the only way to bring them back to life
              is a hard reboot. Furthermore,
              <a href="//kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"
                >not everyone can run Javascript</a
              >. So far for compatibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A good document reader--don't tell me you think
              <a href="/blog/love-hate">this nightmare fuel</a> is decent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Web tries to be everything. It's a shopping centre, a workplace, a
          cafe, a chatroom, a game engine. I just want it to be a good document
          reader.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building a single all-encompassing standard--an everything
          protocol--was a mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have standalone protocols for those things, you know. We have FTP
          and network shares for file sharing, IRC and XMPP for chatting, SMTP
          and DMARC for email, and RSS for syndicating creative work to
          audiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if we don't have protocols for the things the Web is trying--and
          failing--to do, maybe, just maybe, we should build them.
        </p>
