        <h1>The Next Stage of the Web Browser</h1>

        <p>
          In his post
          <a href="//bandukwala.me/on-compositional-window-management/"
            ><cite>On compositional window management</cite></a
          >
          Alexander Bandukwala explores ways in which window managers could be
          improved. I can't help but draw parallels to modern web browsers.
          Applications reimplement the window managers due to the limited
          feature set. Websites reimplement the web browser in the same way.
        </p>

          <a href="/blog/web-sdk">I complained</a> in the past, that I want the
          browser to be <em>just a document reader</em>. But let's face it; it's
          not. It's really just an SDK. But even for an SDK, it's pretty bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          Websites keep reimplementing the browser using JS, because the browser
          <em>sucks</em>. Despite all their fancy advertising and redesigns,
          browser haven't really evolved for the last decade. Yea, they've
          implemented a bunch more ridiculous Javascript APIs, but what real
          added value do they provide to the end-user?
        </p>

        <p>Here's some things I'd want in my browser:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You know all those cookie popups everywhere? What if they were
              just part of the browser? Currently, every website is allowed to
              save cookies by default. There's nothing preventing a website from
              saving cookies anyway when you tap the tiny "no" button. What if
              we reverse that? Whenever a website tries to save cookies, the
              browser displays a standard popup with a clear "no" button that
              actually <em>denies the cookies</em>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              You know how websites have those complicated menus? Yea, what if
              my browser just scraped their <code>sitemap.xml</code> and
              compiled a convient index of the site for me?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              And while we're at it, why not render a table of contents for
              every page? You know, those things Wikipedia and numerous other
              sites are now inserting into their HTML, because our document
              readers--oh sorry, I meant universal SDKs--still don't have this
              feature?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              You know how links you've already visited turn purple (unless the
              website overrides it). What if we would indicate the target
              location of the link in a similar way? Links to other pages on the
              same site would stay as-is, but outgoing links would get some kind
              of extra indication. Also, it would be nice to know the page size
              of the target page upfront, especially on metered connections.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Also
              <a href="/blog/hotfox"
                >bringing back RSS discovery and subscriptions</a
              >
              <em>properly</em> would be pretty nice!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Having publishing built into the browser would truly democratize
              the Web. Instead of the convoluted form-based UIs we could have a
              simple HTML editor builtin that could publish using
              <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"
                >HTTP PUT</a
              >
              if the target server supports it.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              And finally, how about actually useful building blocks for
              applications, instead of this JS+form madness we have now? The
              idea of building up the interface using a markup language such as
              HTML or XML is very good, but what if we could also utilize
              OS-native components in our designs?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Could somebody at Google or Mozilla maybe pretty please make (some of) this reality? /hj</p>
