      <h1>Introducing {du}punkto</h1>

      <p>
        Last year, I posted
        <a href="//classic.geheimesite.nl/v/18/thinking-about-tilde">
          my thoughts on running a tilde/pubnix</a
        >. In a nutshell, I wanted to experiment with setting up a small tilde,
        to learn more about Linux and the internet. And after a few months of
        experimenting, I finally have a system that I'm happy with. So today I'm
        introducing <a href="//dupunkto.org">{du}punkto</a>, my attempt at
        building <em>something</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, {du}punkto is a small group of like-minded people who are
        sharing a VPS. Everyone has access to the server over SSH or Mosh (handy
        for areas with wonky connections). The goal is to learn new things about
        *NIX systems, collaborate on code, experiment, and, above all, have fun.
        I'm co-maintaining it with
        <a href="//dupunkto.org/~msb">MSB</a>, one of my best friends. The
        website isn't finished yet, but it has a little more info, if you're
        curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our server is named <code>du11</code>, after my web server
        <code>s11</code>, and it's running FreeBSD 13. I opted for BSD because I
        like the tidy and organized folder structure, large repos, and jails
        functionality. It's running a bunch of services for developing and
        collaborating on software. Most notably:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Web hosting for every Unix user via a <code>public_html</code> folder
          in their home directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Gitolite server with a cgit web frontend and mirroring to GitHub and
          Codeberg.
        </li>
        <li>FTP storage with a web portal.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It's also possible to run complimentary services in FreeBSD jails, like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A CardDAV and CalDAV server for me and my girlfriend.</li>
        <li>A Miniflux instance for personal use.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm very excited about it. I'm looking forward to seeing what we're
        gonna do with it further.
      </p>

      <p>Future plans:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A handwritten classic Minecraft server.</li>
        <li>
          Gopher and Gemini hosting, using <code>public_gem</code> and
          <code>public_gopher</code> respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          A VSCode server, similar to <a href="//vscode.dev">vscode.dev</a>.
        </li>
        <li>A Matrix homeserver with Whatsapp bridging.</li>
        <li>A Mastodon or Lemmy instance?</li>
      </ul>
