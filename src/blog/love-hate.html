        <h1>love, hate</h1>

        <p>
          This lyric from Olivia O'Brien's song
          <cite>hate u love u</cite> summarizes my relationship with the Web
          almost perfectly:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ATgDc6e4sPn84hvJsAmPt">
          <p>
            I hate you, I love you<br />
            I hate that I love you
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't want to, but I can't put<br />
            nobody else above you
          </p>
        </blockquote>

          Cause, as a developer, I l√≥ve the Web. The web browser is a blank
          canvas that can be used to build virtually anything. HTML, CSS,
          Javascript--the languages used to build websites--are easy to grasp
          but at the same time extremely powerful and versatile. There are APIs
          for literally anything I'd want to build. And unlike low-level
          languages such as C and Rust, a website doesn't make me to deal with a
          complicated toolchain; I don't need to think about complex
          cross-compilation, memory allocation, dynamic linkers or glibc. I
          simply upload my HTML files to my server using <code>rsync</code>, and
          it automagically Just Works(TM).
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as a consumer, I absolutely detest the Web. It feels like
          it's turned from a wild, collaborative, global creative space into
          something akin to a shopping mall. It's just
          <a href="//how-i-experience-web-today.com">straight up depressing</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone's talking about <em>monetization</em>,
          <em>growth hacking</em>, <em>ad-revenue</em>. Everywhere I go, I'm met
          with pages full of plausible sounding AI-generated SEO-optimized
          nonsense. I get asked to accept these <em>delicious</em> cookies, to
          sign up for the newsletter, and to create a (<em>free!!</em>) account.
          Also: <em>this content is better in the app</em>! And we're
          <em
            >announcing our next-gen AI-powered blockchain startup, check it
            out!</em
          >
          All while some completely unrelated video starts autoplaying in the
          background. And that's without even talking about the ads.
        </p>

        <p>
          These websites are not built for you <em>to read</em>, they are
          designed for <em>extracting value from your visit</em>. Desperately
          trying to squeeze every last drop of data out of you, before you
          inevitably close the tab.
        </p>

            It's not that I think creative people shouldn't be fairly
            compensated. Of course they should. But this isn't about them. This
            is about a cultural shift that turns the Web into a business
            platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you make something--art, music, film--and put it online for
            others to see, but also request to be compensated for your work,
            that's totally fair. But what we're seeing now is companies
            hijacking the Web, replacing genuine people writing making real
            things, with SEO-optimized clickbait meant to make money quick.
