        <h1>Thoughts on the mobile phone ban</h1>

        <p>
          Last month the Dutch government announced that from next year on
          mobile phones will be banned in high school. As a student who is
          currently in high school, I think it's a fundamentally good
          development, but the media attention around it just feels wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          The news is full of items of cherry-picked comments from teenagers who
          feel "relieved" because they "finally talk to each other". But also
          teenagers who are sad because "they won't have any memories of high
          school if they can't take photos". They present a greatly exaggerated
          story praising this measure the government imposed to protect the
          youth against themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's all so over the top. Contrary to popular belief, teenagers
          <em>do</em> talk to each other, even in the presence of a mobile
          phone. In breaks, we play card games like Uno and Bullshit. We read
          books. We complain about how stupid school and homework is. You know,
          normal stuff. And our phones have a place too. Sometimes we play
          mobile games in the break, like
          <link href="//www.evilapples.com" target="_blank">Evil Apples</link> or
          <link href="//garticphone.com/" target="_blank">Gartic Phone</link>. But
          that's still something we do <em>together</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          And, yes, phones are distracting. Yes, they cause mayhem from time to
          time. Yes, social media is shit. I am very much aware. But all of that
          is also true for adults. These devices and the apps on them are made
          to be extremely addictive, it's their fucking business model. It's not
          just teenagers who get addicted. And it's certainly not our fault that
          we get addicted. Even the people who built these apps in the first
          place, who know exactly how they work and what tricks are used to
          exploit our psychology, they still
          <link href="//thesocialdilemma.com">aren't able to restrain themselves</link
          >. Adults aren't magically immune.
        </p>

        <p>
          It feels like it's a bunch of grey birds going "kids these days...",
          "you can't get off your phones, and now we're going to take them
          away", "it's for your own good!" and then continuing to celebrate on
          social media. Hypocrisy at its peak.
        </p>

        <p>
          So yes, I think it's great that phones have been banned in high
          schools. The next step would be everywhere else (and especially the
          parlement).

                Schools spent years digitizing everything. Schedules, grades,
                homework, study materials and more are now all exclusively
                available in web applications. They made this move with the
                assumption that these platforms would always be accessible for
                students via their mobile phone (a wrong assumption by the way,
                because this excludes students like myself that would rather
                leave their phone at home). How are schools going to deal with
                this?

              <p>
                How are schools going to enforce this? They've been burdened
                with enough additional administrative tasks already. And what
                even counts as a mobile phone?
                <del
                  >Do all mobile devices count? What about my iPad? Or an old
                  iPod Touch? My DIY Raspberry Pi Zero project with a
                  rectangular touch screen? And what if it were a square
                  instead? And what about smartwatches? They can TikTok too.
                  Does every portable device with an internet connection fall
                  under this new law?</del

                  >Update: I read the law on rijksoverheid.nl and they include
                  "smartphones", "tablets", and "smartwatches".
                  <em>However</em>, they do not provide a definition for these
                  terms. Disappointing.</ins
