      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Hi. So, you stumbled upon my blog, cool.</p>

      <p>
        I'm a random teenager from the Netherlands, and this is my little corner
        of the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        I post little notes about my life here. I made this site because I love
        minimalism and the initial idea of the web: a giant library of
        knowledge. This is my lil' corner of that library—as lightweight and
        simple as it can get. I'm not trying to scream; I'm just looking to
        talk.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is mostly for myself, but you can read along if you're
        inclined. I'm planning to do mostly long-form casual writing. For now
        posts will be published exclusively on the Web, but I'm looking into
        Gemini and Gopher hosting.
      </p>

      <p>I'm really bad at these “welcome!!” kind of posts. Sowwy!</p>
