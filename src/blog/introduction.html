        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Hi. So, you stumbled upon my blog, cool.</p>

        <p>
          I'm a random teenager from the Netherlands, and this is my little
          corner of the internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I post little notes about my life here. I made this site because I
          love minimalism and the initial idea of the web: a giant library of
          knowledge. This is my lil' corner of that library--as lightweight and
          simple as it can get. I'm not trying to scream; I'm just looking to
          talk.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog is mostly for myself, but you can read along if you're
          inclined. I'm planning to do mostly long-form casual writing. For now
          posts will be published exclusively on the Web, but I'm looking into
          Gemini and Gopher hosting.
        </p>

        <p>I'm really bad at these “welcome!!” kind of posts. Sowwy!</p>
