        <h1>In favor of the small</h1>

        <p>
          Since the internet went mainstream in the 90s, information has been
          readily available for everyone. But can it be trusted? What makes a
          reliable source? At school, people seem to think 'the bigger the
          better'. Big sites are generally considered trustworthy, while small
          and relatively unknown sites, like personal blogs or forums, are
          off-limits. However, imho small blogs are typically better sources
          than those big news outlets.

          For one, random people online usually don't have any financial
          incentives. They're not writing to please an advertiser, publisher or
          particular audience--they're writing because they're passionate about
          the subject. This makes a huge difference. There's no money at stake,
          no undisclosed incentives, no monetary gain. They don't need to
          clickbait their writing; there's no reason to maximize views. A
          blogger isn't financially dependent on their blog, so there's no goal
          to sell ads. They don't
          <em>need anything</em> from their readers.
        </p>

          Furthermore, the articles on credible news sites are generally written
          by journalists. That's good, because they fact-check and remain
          objective and neutral. However, a journalist will always be a
          generalist: they know a little about a lot. On the other hand,
          bloggers can be specialists and will often have a more in-depth
          understanding of the topic. In other words: specialized blogs are
          often more accurate than media coverage on the same subject. Just read
          some news items on
          <a href="//rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/"
            >topics you're familiar with yourself</a
          >:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="https://rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/">
          <p>
            I've mentioned a few times how easy it is to pick apart inaccuracies
            in media coverage on a topic you know about, and the unease that
            sets in when you realise every topic likely has the same issues.
          </p>

          Moreover, bloggers don't have any restrictions while writing: they can
          make their articles as long, technical, and detailed as they please,
          not having to tailor them to a specific audience. However, a
          journalist has to make their writing accessible to a large audience,
          exchanging valuable detail for readability.

          On blogs and forums, I know that what I'm reading is the authentic and
          personal experience of an actual person -- not some corporate
          marketing bullshit. I'm not alone in this btw; there's a reason people
          <a href="//dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying"
            >keep appending "reddit" to the end of their searches</a
          >. Small blogs are written by <em>people</em>. I think that scares
          institutions like schools, which were created in a world where the
          only other big institutions, like media companies and publishers, had
          the ability to put stuff into the world. "Oh no, actual people are now
          able to write and publish stuff on their own!" PANIC!
        </p>

        <p>
          We should be more kind towards stuff written by people. It's not
          scary; it's just different.

            The blogs I talk about here are not the commercial BuzzFeed kind of
            blogs, but rather the things you'd find on the
            <a href="//indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> or
            <a href="//neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Small</a>
