        <h1>In favor of the small</h1>

        <p>
          Since the internet went mainstream in the 90s, information has been
          readily available for everyone. But can it be trusted? What makes a
          reliable source? At school, we seem to get taught 'the bigger the
          better'. Big sites are generally considered trustworthy, while small
          and relatively unknown sites, like personal blogs or forums, are
          off-limits. However, in my experience small, specialized blogs are
          typically especially better sources than those big news outlets.
        </p>

        <p>
          For one, random people only usually aren't writing to please an
          advertiser, publisher or particular audience--they're writing because
          they're passionate about the subject. This makes a huge difference, as
          there is no financial incentive, no money at stake, no undisclosed
          incentives, no monetary gain. They don't need to clickbait their
          writing; there's no reason to maximize views. A blogger that isn't
          financially dependent on their blog has no goal to track you or sell
          ads. They don't <em>need anything</em> from their readers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, articles on credible news sites are generally written by
          journalists, which is good. They fact-check and remain objective and
          neutral. But, a journalist will always be a generalist: they know a
          little about a lot. Bloggers, on the other hand, can be specialists
          and will often have a more in-depth understanding of the topic. In
          other words: specialized blogs are often more accurate than media
          coverage on the same subject. Just read some news items on
          <a href="//rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/"
            >topics you're familiar with yourself</a
          >:
        </p>

        <blockquote
          cite="https://rubenerd.com/erwin-knolls-law-of-media-accuracy/">
          <p>
            I've mentioned a few times how easy it is to pick apart inaccuracies
            in media coverage on a topic you know about, and the unease that
            sets in when you realise every topic likely has the same issues.
          </p>

          Moreover, bloggers don't have any restrictions on their writing: they
          can make their articles as long, technical, and detailed as they
          please, not having to tailor them to a specific audience, whereas a
          journalist has to make their writing accessible to a large audience,
          exchanging valuable detail for readability.

          On blogs and forums, I know that what I'm reading is the authentic and
          personal experience of an actual person -- not some corporate
          marketing bullshit. I'm not alone in this btw; there's a reason people
          <a href="//dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying"
            >keep appending "reddit" to the end of their searches</a
          >. Small blogs are written by <em>people</em>. I think that scares
          institutions like schools, which were created in a world where the
          only other big institutions, like media companies and publishers, had
          the ability to put stuff into the world. "Oh no, actual people are now
          able to write and publish stuff on their own!" PANIC!
        </p>

        <p>
          The advent of the internet caused a huge shift in the way we find and
          consume information. And we love change--if we're the one doing it.
          But for the rest of us, change is a threat. A threat to what is
          familiar. Familiar is nice. Familiar is comfortable. But that doesn't
          mean familiar is good. Yet our education system keeps desperately
          clinging onto what it finds familiar.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what if we instead embrace the internet and the voices it gives to
          ordinary people? Maybe a more diverse and less formalised set of
          sources will actually be an enrichment for class. Offer us new
          perspectives we hadn't thought of before. So, I think we should be
          more kind towards stuff written by people. It's not scary; it's just
          different.

            The blogs I talk about here are not the commercial BuzzFeed kind of
            blogs, but rather the things you'd find on the
