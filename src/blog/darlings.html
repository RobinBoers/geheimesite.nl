          The saying goes "kill your darlings". When I have trouble fitting
          paragraphs into a cohesive whole, it's often because I've tangled up
          multiple concepts or ideas; essentially trying--and failing--to create
          a coherent two out of two, although related, seperate
          concepts--leaving them both underdeveloped.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those moments the best solution is to split up my text, to provide
          each idea the space and care it deserves. So maybe don't kill the poor
          things. Just <em>viciously</em> pull them apart.

            This is a RSS only post. Not a secret; just not noteworthy enough to
            be listed on the index.
