      <h1>Banning phones is not solving anything</h1>

      <p>
        A few days ago, I posted some of my thoughts regarding the new mobile
        phone ban in high schools in the Netherlands. I want to add a few more
        things:
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the fundamental problem is not the phones themselves. Why are
        phones distracting? Push notifications and FOMO.
        <em>The phones are not the problem, social media is</em>. And because we
        failed to properly regulate social media, phones are getting banned.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ban is a prime example of symptom relief. The government is doing
        nothing to actually address the problem; all they're doing is
        prohibiting the manifestation. The ban will <em>not</em> help students
        overcome their addiction. Neither is the ban preventing social media use
        and all the problems than come with it; students are simply going to use
        different devices to access their beloved Snapchat selfies.
