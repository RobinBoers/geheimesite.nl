    <p>
      This website (everything residing on "geheimesite.nl" and previously
      "roblog.nl", excluding subdomains) is volatile. It can, and will, change.
      <a href="//www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI"> My URLs aren't cool</a>, sorry!
      Attempts to link to this site are futile.
    </p>

    <!--<p>
        In the past, I've always tried to break as little as possible by setting
        up redirects for old URLs. However, I've come to the conclusion that
        doing that <i>forever</i> is a lot of effort I'd rather spend elsewhere.
        Besides, a lot of the pages simply don't exist anymore.
      </p>-->

    <p>
      If you do want to link to something and be confident that the link won't
      die, please link to the appropriate page in
      <a href="//classic.geheimesite.nl"> The Archives</a>. I am committed to
      keeping the URL schemes of <a>classic.geheimesite.nl</a> and
      <a>blog.geheimesite.nl</a> stable.

      Note: the path to the RSS feed will always stay
      <a href="/index.xml">/index.xml</a>.
