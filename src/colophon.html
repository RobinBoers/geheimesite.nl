        I spent a lot of time and effort tweaking the server configuration. It
        currently does compression, caching, CSP and a bunch of privacy-related
        headers, because
        <em>the modern web absolutely sucks by default</em>, and I prefer
        visitors to not be tracked <em>by their own browsers</em>.
