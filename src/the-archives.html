      <h1>The Archives</h1>

      <p>
        This site was first launched in the last few months of 2017, when I was
        still in primary school. Since then, a lot has happened. I've torn down
        and rebuilt the site countless of times. With this page I hope to offer
        some insight into the development and creative process that shaped the
        site as it is today.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I started out on my webdevelopment journey, I was blissfully
        unaware of <em>literally anything</em>. This includes version control. I
        recovered older versions of the site from backups, folders called
        <i>v0.1</i>, <i>v0.3.4</i> etc. I also lost a bunch of versions, and
        lots backups contained so much buggy and insecure PHP (think of exposing
        the file system for arbitrary use via a GUI), that I didn’t dare to
        reupload it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways, here’s a non-exhaustive list of previous versions of this site.
        Beware of the (many) dead links :)

              <!--Unfortunately I lost the very first files I uploaded to the Web, because they have been overwritten with this version.-->
              The site is still very much a work-in-progress at this stage. You
              can also clearly see the resemblance to
              <a href="/nanonauten" target="_blank">the example site</a> from
              the

              I used to write it.

            <p>
              The site originally featured a nice background of some canyon with
              a waterfall in it. However, inexperienced as I was, I directly
              hotlinked to the image instead of downloading and serving it
              myself. <em>Oof!</em> The site that was hosting the image is no
              longer hosting it, and any trace of it has vanished from the Web.
              Well, shit happens I guess.

              This version was heavily inspired by the design of the

              At this point I discovered W3Schools and completely went
              over-the-top with JS-powered widgets, slideshows and what-not. Ew.

              This version is very special to me. The design is brilliantly
              simple. I <em>love</em> it! This is also when I started
              experimenting with writing my own JavaScript and PHP, instead of
              copy-pasting stuff in, like I did before. I learned so much while
              writing this, most of it because of two

            <p>
              At this point I wrote a bunch of different websites and "apps"
              that were scattered all over the place. I decided to unify them
              under a single navigation bar, inspired by the way Google apps
              share a common menu in the top-right. This is also the moment I
              decided to drop the undercover spy content that had been the main
              topic of the site for almost two years at that point. Instead, I
              proudly presented my projects on the homepage.

              I still liked pink, but I wanted something more simple, and
              something that better reflected my ideals regarding
              webdevelopment. So, I redesigned the site according to
              <a
                href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/"
                target="_blank"
                >best practices for inclusive textual websites</a
              >. It has a heavy focus on correctness, adaptability,
              accessibility, security, performance and sustainability. This
              iteration of the site was heavily inspired by various versions of
              <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221222075138/https://bt.ht/"

              While I was very pleased with the previous interation of my site,
              I felt like it constrained me too much. Don't get me wrong, it
              worked wonderfully, and ticked all the boxes for what I consider a
              great website. However, I felt like it didn't fully capture
              <em>me</em>. So, I redesigned again. I went with a very simple
              monochrome color palette, based on the colors and fonts the from
              the user agent. This iteration was inspired by
              <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank">100r.co</a>,
              <a href="https://mat.tl" target="_blank">mat.tl</a>,
              <a href="https://wesleyac.com" target="_blank">wesleyac.com</a>,
              <a href="https://bt.ht" target="_blank">bt.ht</a>, and
              <a href="https://rubenerd.com" target="_blank">rubenerd.com</a>. I
              like it a lot, it feels more free-form and somehow very cozy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For reasons still unknown, I decided to handcode again, which I
              hadn't done since at least version 15. I like it tho; it allows me
              to perfectionate the HTML, which I couldn't really do with
              Markdown.
