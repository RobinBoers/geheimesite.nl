This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). I think I'm a bit late to the party, but whatever. No one cares anyway. For those very confused: this page describes what I'm currently up to.

## School

I'm currently in 4VWO. I think you British people would call it Year 11, and American folks would call it Grade 9 or something. These are some things I'm doing for school at the moment.

-   Studying for tests
-   Keeping up with homework
-   Only nice subjects and german (I dropped all the other shit this year)

## Personal

-   Finish & polish the backend for my RSS reader
-   Build a nice frontend for it using local website and package it using [elixir-desktop](https://github.com/elixir-desktop/desktop)

{{< hr >}}

## IndieWeb

-   Build a proper (working) media endpoint for [my microblog](https://micro.geheimesite.nl)
-   Add delete/update support to my micropub endpoint
-   Figure out why posting to [indieweb.xyz](https://indieweb.xyz) sometimes doesn't work

I will probably keep putting these off for another six years, but here ye go.
