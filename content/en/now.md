This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). I think I'm a bit late to the party, but whatever. No one cares anyway. For those very confused: this page describes what I'm currently up to.

## School

I'm currently in 5VWO. I think you British people would call it Year 12, and American folks would call it Grade 10 or something. These are some things I'm doing for school at the moment.

-   Keeping up with homework
-   Only nice subjects and german (I dropped all the other shit last year)

## Personal

-   Write my own programming language.
-   A small web browser? (gemini, gopher ...)

{{< hr >}}

## IndieWeb

-   Build a proper (working) media endpoint for [my microblog](https://micro.geheimesite.nl).
-   Add delete/update support to my micropub endpoint.
-   Figure out why posting to [indieweb.xyz](https://indieweb.xyz) sometimes doesn't work.

## Backlog

-   A reimagined Somtoday app/client for mobile with additional features.
-   Build a little tool to automatically send email notifications to my followers when I post something (basically a self-hosted [follow.it](https://follow.it) alternative).
-   Build an app that can download YouTube videos like podcasts on my phone.
-   Reimagine the entire web stack in Rust with a friend (more info coming soon :smile:).

I will probably keep putting these off for another six years, but here ye go.
