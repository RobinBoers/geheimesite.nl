        <p>
            Hi, my name is Robin. I was born {{< age >}} years ago in Vlaardingen, Netherlands but I have lived in Maassluis for my entire life. I love to thinker with code and I currently work as Junior Developer at Qdentity in Maasland. This site is a place for me to showcase my projects. I also have a <a href="https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en">blog</a> where I write about programming, webdevelopment, and other cool shit.

Additionally I play handball at [SC Twist](https://www.sctwist.nl), and I enjoy cycling.

I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/RobinBoers) where I open-source most of my projects.

## How I got into programming

I've been programming since group 7 (2017). I got into it because I saw a book at the local library titled [Creating with code: How to built a website](https://web.archive.org/web/20220625081814/http://nano-tips.com/). I had been a huge nerd who knew what every button in Windows did, so I decided to build a website, which I launched end-2017. I loved secret agents, so the first versions (up until redesign 9) were built for a imaginary organisation called the DDDD, which protected the univserse from the evil alter-ego of mankind. You can find those versions of the site in my [Website Library](/website/overview).

## Skills

I'm pretty good at building websites. I'm comfortable with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Moreover, I learned a lot about building dynamic websites using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView over at Qdentity.

Furthermore, I enjoy working with [Phaser](https://phaser.io) and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org). I'm currently trying to learn more about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and other low-level languages. I also want to know a bit more about  [programming language design](https://git.geheimesite.nl/grape-lang) and Android app design.

I regularly post updates on my blog about my findings. I try to keep learning (because it's fun).

## About the site

My website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is hosted at [bHosted](https://www.bhosted.nl/?ref=97f4c4a4b13e269e12cfd4f0352ba527). Both my blog and this site are [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/RobinBoers/geheimesite.nl), but I have yet to decide on a license.
