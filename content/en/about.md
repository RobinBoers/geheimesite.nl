        <p>
            Hi, my name is Robin. I was born 15 years ago in Vlaardingen, Netherlands but I have lived in Maassluis for my entire life. I love to thinker with code and I currently work as Junior Developer at Qdentity in Maasland. This site is a place for me to showcase my projects. I also have a <a href="https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en">blog</a> where I write about programming, webdevelopment, and other cool shit.

Additionally I play handball and I have a (long-forgotten) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx4li1iMygs5KtqgcU5KGRw), where I post videos about programming and video-editing. I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/RobinBoers) where I open-source most of my projects.

## How I got into programming

I've been programming since group 7 (2017). I got into it because I saw a book at the local library titled [Creating with code: How to built a website](http://www.nano-tips.com). I had been a huge nerd who knew what every button in Windows did, so I decided to build a website, which I launched end-2017. I loved secret agents, so the first versions (up until redesign 9) were built for a imaginary organisation called the DDDD, which protected the univserse from the evil alter-ego of mankind. You can find those versions of the site in my [Website Library](/website/overview).

After I built my first website I went to CoderDojo. CoderDojo is a monthly meetup in our local library where kids can practise programming. At CoderDojo two amazing people taught me how to write PHP and how to use MySQL databases.

Currently, I'm learning more about the inner-workings of Linux, Elixir and Phoenix Liveview. I regularly post updates on my blog about my findings. I try to keep learning (because it's fun).

## About the site

My website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is hosted at [bHosted](https://www.bhosted.nl/?ref=97f4c4a4b13e269e12cfd4f0352ba527). Both my blog and this site are [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/RobinBoers/geheimesite.nl), but I have yet to decide on a license.
