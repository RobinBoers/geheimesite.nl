I'm webdesigner, Elixir programmer and teenager. I'm 15 years old and live in the Netherlands. Welcome to my website! This is kinda like my personal playground. I publish my projects like games, websites and apps here and I also regularly post to [my blog](https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en).

Wanna know more about me? Check the [about me](/en/about) page. If you want to see my work you can take a look at the [projects](/en/projects) page. If you're mostly interested in the code, check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/RobinBoers).
