Hi, my name is Robin. I'm a {{ age }}-year-old teenager from the Netherlands. I work at [Qdentity](https://qdentity.com) as Junior Developer. I’m currently in 5VWO. I think you British people would call it Year 12, and American folks would call it Grade 10 or something.

I love building random things related to the Web, servers and Linux. I'm fluent in Elixir, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and the Linux commandline. I also know a little PHP too.

Some random facts about me: I have a cat called Coco (who apparently has an instagram profile: [@coconootje23](https://instagram.com/coconootje23), go follow him!). I absolutely *love* Belgian waffles (but stroopwafels are nice too). I enjoy playing Minecraft. I'm very clumsy; I tend to break things.

## Skills

I'm pretty good at building websites. I’m fluent in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Elixir and Phoenix. Additionally, I'm comfortable with the Linux commandline. I can work with PHP and WordPress, but I'd rather use a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). My English is also decent (as you might see :wink:).

I regularly post updates on my blog about my findings. I try to keep learning (because it’s fun).

## About the site

My site is built using my own static site generator called [Chop](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/libre0b11/chop), and is hosted at [bHosted](https://www.bhosted.nl/?ref=97f4c4a4b13e269e12cfd4f0352ba527). All contents on it -- at least those that I made -- are in the [public domain](https://stpeter.im/writings/essays/publicdomain.html) (specifically CC0). The [source code](//git.dupunkto.org/~robin/geheimesite.nl) is also publicly available and licensed under the AGPLv3.

The site has a very heavy focus on simplicity, accessibility and sustainability. It's built using semantic HTML and some [~400 lines of handwritten CSS](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/geheimesite.nl/tree/templates/web/static/main.css?h=next). Content is written in plain Markdown, which is then converted to HTML and Gemtext pages using [Chop](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/libre0b11/chop), my own static site generator. Images are automatically downsized to 600x and optimized during build. Similarly, CSS is minified. With exception of the background, it uses the colorscheme and fonts defined by the user agent (which is configurable in many browsers).

The server has been configured to [compress](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/geheimesite.nl/tree/templates/web/static/.htaccess?h=next#n58) and sent the [correct caching headers](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/geheimesite.nl/tree/templates/web/static/.htaccess?h=next#n69). It also enforces [a very strict CSP](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/geheimesite.nl/tree/templates/web/static/.htaccess?h=next#n40), which disables any scripts and insecure content. I also send a bunch of privacy-related headers, because *the modern web absolutely sucks by default*, and I prefer visitors to not be tracked *by their own browsers*.

## Contact

My public emailaddress is [hello@geheimesite.nl](mailto:hello@geheimesite.nl). You can also send me a friend request on Discord, my handle is **ThatComputerBoy#9914**.

I absolutely hate social media, so I’m not on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok or Facebook. You can [follow me via RSS](/follow) tho.
